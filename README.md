# InfiniteTidal

Automated trial resubscription for Tidal using Gmail aliases.

## Setup

To use InfiniteTidal, you’ll need a working Gmail account. This tool leverages Gmail’s alias feature and the Gmail API to automate signups.

### 1. Configure Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project.
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library** and enable the **Gmail API**.

### 2. Configure OAuth Consent Screen (Crucial Step)

Since your app is in "Testing" mode, you must manually add yourself as a user.

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen** (or **Branding** > **Audience** in the new UI).
2. Select **External** as the User Type and click **Create**.
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **App Name:** InfiniteTidal
   - **User Support Email:** Your email address
   - **Developer Contact Information:** Your email address
4. Click **Save and Continue** through the "Scopes" section (no changes needed here for testing).
5. **IMPORTANT:** In the **Test Users** (or **Audience**) section:
   - Click **+ ADD USERS**.
   - Enter the Gmail address you will use to log in (e.g., `your.email@gmail.com`).
   - Click **Save**.
   
   *If you skip this step, you will get a "Access Blocked: App has not completed the Google verification process" error (Error 403: access_denied).*

### 3. Create Credentials

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
2. Click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.
3. Select **Desktop app** as the application type.
4. Download the JSON file, rename it to `credentials.json`, and place it in the `src/` directory.

### 4. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the required Google client libraries installed:
```bash
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```

### 5. First Run

When you run the script for the first time:
1. A browser window will open asking you to authorize the application.
2. You might see a warning screen saying "Google hasn't verified this app".
3. Click **Advanced** > **Go to InfiniteTidal (unsafe)** to proceed.
4. Once authorized, a `token.json` file will be created in the `src/` directory for future authentications.

**Note:**  
All signup emails generated by InfiniteTidal will be delivered to the Gmail inbox you configure. If you prefer to keep these separate from your main inbox, consider creating a dedicated Gmail account just for this tool.
